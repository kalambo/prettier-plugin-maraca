# Prettier Maraca Plugin

This plugin adds support for the Maraca language to Prettier.

## Install

yarn add prettier-plugin-maraca --dev
```

or

npm install prettier-plugin-maraca --save-dev
```

## Editor Support

### Atom

Prettier plugins are supported by Atom, using the prettier-atom package.

### VS Code

For VS Code, the prettier-vscode currently doesn't support plugins. This is being tracked in https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode/issues/395, which includes a workaround, where you install plugins directly into the extension directory, rather than into your project.
